# Parent Library

This component is part of a larger components library, [react-ui-base](https://github.com/snowcoders/react-ui-base). The goal is to keep all the core logic and base css styles in a single location, that way building out new UI component libraries cheaper and faster (and less buggy).

We highly recommend visiting the react-ui-base repository to understand how to customize the css along with see examples.

You can also view all the components on our demo site https://snowcoders.github.io/react-ui-base/

# This component

Renders a simple checkbox component with a button as the main visual element that triggers a checkbox element. This allows for greater css customizations while maintaining the same API as a checkbox.
